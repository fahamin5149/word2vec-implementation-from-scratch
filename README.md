# Word2Vec Implementation from Scratch

This project implements the Word2Vec model from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras to generate word embeddings. Word embeddings are essential for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enabling computers to understand and interpret human language more effectively.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

- **Data Collection**: Gathered a large text corpus suitable for training the Word2Vec model.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and tokenized the text data to prepare it for training. This involved removing punctuation, handling capitalization, and ensuring consistency in tokenization.

### 2. Model Implementation

- **Skip-gram and CBOW Models**: Implemented both the skip-gram and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) models.
  - **Skip-gram**: Predicts context words given a center word.
  - **CBOW**: Predicts a center word given context words.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Designed neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras to learn word vectors from the text data.

### 3. Training and Optimization

- **Model Training**: Trained the Word2Vec models using the prepared text corpus.
- **Optimization**: Used the Adam optimizer to efficiently train the neural network.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted experiments to optimize parameters such as learning rate and embedding dimensions to enhance model performance.

### 4. Evaluation and Visualization

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluated the quality of word embeddings using similarity and analogy tasks.
- **Visualization**: Visualized word embeddings to gain insights into learned representations and their relationships.

### 5. Applications and Insights

- **NLP Tasks**: Demonstrated applications of word embeddings in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition.
- **Significance**: Explored theoretical and practical aspects of word embedding techniques, highlighting their importance in modern NLP applications.

## Usage

- **Requirements**: Ensure TensorFlow and Keras are installed (`pip install tensorflow keras`).
- **Training**: Use provided  notebooks to train the Word2Vec models on your own text data.
- **Visualization**: Utilize visualization tools to explore and interpret the generated word embeddings.
